Data-Processing-Pipeline
Documentation for data preprocessing steps in a peer-reviewed medical study. 
1. Objective
Address a medical image classification task in histopathology analysis. 

Maintain reproducibility while adhering to ethical research practices.

2. Processing Steps
2.1 Duplicate Removal
A small subset of duplicate samples (â‰ˆ1%) was identified and removed.

2.2 Size Recovery via Augmentation
Purpose: Preserve original data scale for fair benchmarking.

Operations:

Geometric transformations (e.g., rotation, flipping).

Control: Augmented samples strictly derived from the cleaned data.

3. Compliance & Ethics
